"1","Dash Starkey","Reviewed in Australia on 9 October 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars","        If you already have the Alexa app and buy this on your Amazon account, it automatically connects once you turn it on. So using it is so simple. A great little unit. Sound is strong and positive. She's very quick and responsive as are all the Echo's. Once you get one, you just want more! Bought an Arlec Smart LED Globe and Alexa connects it instantly once it is set up in it's GRID app. Alexa can dim it, change it's colour. So much fun. Can even understand my father who has Parkinson's and can't project his voice clearly. In a semi noisy room it can pick up his commands.  "

"3","Dash Starkey","Reviewed in Australia on 9 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Out of all the smart speakers out there, Alexa still holds the number 1 position in this lower class of smart speakers mainly because of that microphone. It still cuts through the noise, doesn't do anything smart when it doesn't need to (Google Nest Mini's loves to try to do more background processing for whatever reason and as a result, kills its performance) and gets even better with this current generation with temperature sensors and ultrasound detection for those times when you need to turn on an audio detection capability. I haven't had a chance to use the ultrasound detection smarts yet to see how good the home intrusion works and am looking forward to seeing if it can handle false positives such as when thunder is in the air or when some construction noise happens outside.All in all, love it. Except the colour. Gone are the lighter hazier colour tones from the 4th generation and in its place, I get a dark harsher blue which is not as appealing and doesn't fit well except in your home office settings.Apart from this, a great smart speaker that will serve your home well.

"4","I have some already and they are absolutely amazing. ","Reviewed in Australia on 30 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        a for amazing. So easy to use. Quality product by Amazon. I have one hooked up to the TV and the other for primarily music in  the family room. Great sound. And Alexa is getting used to my pronunciation. Love it. I purchased a few to spread around the house so I have music everywhere I go. Absolutely recommend this unit.  "
"5","Michael","Reviewed in Australia on 20 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Good -> the usual things I ask, what's the weather, play music, set timers and reminders.Bad - or perhaps my misunderstanding, that it should only recognise voices that was completed during setup.  If the room has the TV on or other noise, then it does take a few attempts for the device to hear you.  "
