"1","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","Ish Go","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 3 November 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars","        Just like the YouTube audiophiles said. Absolutely amazing for the price and for non-wired earphones. Has a decent soundstage and can suprisingly distinguish sounds well enough on lossless music. I've even found myself thinking I was hearing people around me when I left YouTube playing. The noise cancelling and the microphone quality are good enough. Only real downside is the battery life. I believe the earphones last 4 and the case adds 12 hours. I haven't run out of battery yet though.  "

"8","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","Audio Reviews Downunder","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Sweden on 17 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Die einzigen Dinge die man daran aussetzen kann sind das offene Design des Ladecases - in der Praxis war das allerdings noch nie ein Problem - und dass man sie nicht zu einem anderen gepairten Device connecten kann, wenn sie aktuell zu einem anderen Connected sind (d.h. man muss eventuell zuerst disconnecten oder das device abdrehen - mit anderen die das schon koennen, hatte ich aber auch schon das Problem, dass ein device das gerade aufgedreht wird die connection ""stiehlt"", das passiert hier nicht).Die Touch Steuerung an den Buds selbst ist sehr sensible, was gut ist wenn man steuern will, schlecht, wenn man sie einfach in der hand haelt und aus versehen auf play drueckt.Soundqualitaet ist fuer normale Menschen kaum von teureren Kopfhoerern unterscheidbar.Noise isolation ist gut, eventuell sogar besser als bei Airpods Pro (zumindest 1.st Gen).Zum transparency modus kann ich nicht viel sagen, da ich ihn quasi nie benutze.Sie koennen Problemlos mit teureren Kopfhoerern von Namhaften Herstellern mit halten. Das Preisleistungsverhaeltniss ist unschlagbar.    "

"11","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","Anton Johansson","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 22 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Very affordable. Light and comfortable. Clear mids and highs that distort sometimes at louder volumes. Lacks bass. Low to average battery life relative to the entire field but not bad for the price bracket. Fiddly to replace buds into charging case, but cool 90s anime design. Audio feedback is an anime girl voice which might be annoying for some. Only single status LED. Touch area was not 100% consistent detecting touches but got it right most of the time. Noise cancelling not the best but better than expected at this price. Picks up and passes through wind noise a lot, but fine for indoor/stationary use. A couple of fit and finish gripes here and there, and doesn't look like it would take to sweat or water splash too well, but can't complain for the price.Phone app was not on google play and required sideloading so don't bother. Default settings are fine. YouTube video sync lags a bit when connected to standalone APTx TaoTronics transmitter (TT-BA08), but works fine directly to android phone.Had a weird connection issue where one channel would cut out for a moment, then come back. Could possibly be interference from BT signal traffic of other nearby devices, not really sure.These would make an amazing gift.  "
"12","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","Cliente Amazon","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 1 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Audio quality: 10/10 (for price. Ridiculously strong bass, good mids. Only weak on treble, eq should help.)Transparency: 8/10 (not too much hiss, everything audible)NC: 6/10 (blocks noise ok, wind still audible. Insane to even have at this price.)Battery: 4/10 ( I can see it go down as I'm looking at the percentage. To be expected from this level but was hoping for better)Just got mine today. QC is definitely an issue with moondrop. Had problens with the Chu and the right buds on these also turn off by themselves. The experience is worse compared to my Sonys but audio quality is great. All the compromises are worth it for this level of audio fidelity. The mic indoors is also great. How these passed QC with a massive dent in the case is a riddle to me.  "

Son buenos y cumplen con su función.    "
"14","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","Amazon Customer","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 16 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Been using them since they came out.I like them a lot. Sound is good, app works well (you need to download the .apk from moondrops homepage at the time of writing this).Battery life is so-so, but you have plenty of charge in the case.But the case....*Charge port is on the bottom - not too smart*No lid - dirt will enter and accumulate over time. The ""wells"" the headphones sit in is deep and narrow, so the contact points are very hard to clean. Bad connections is eminent after a couple of months use.* No lid - although the magnets hold the headphones in place fairly well, if you put it in a pocket or bag, you will constantly get connections from the moondrops while moving. This can be very annoying if you're using other headphones, but especially so if talking on the phone at the time this happens. Also you might need to search for a lost headphone in your bag once in a while.The leather case you can buy for them seems to be of really bad quality, so I wouldn't suggest getting that, BUT there are some really nice 3d-files out there to print, that seem to solve or minimize the problems with the case.Either way, if you enjoy good sounding items I would still recommend them. If you need 3+ hours of battery life and want some really punchy bass, you might want to look at some Sonys or something instead, but at this price range, I seriously doubt you'll find anything better. Probably not at double the price either.TL;DR: Sound good. Case and battery bad. Still worth. Also I think they look cool.  "

"16","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","Amazon Customer","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 6 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Alright, the sound is great. It comfortably beats the Moondrop Chu, and I can in rare cases prefer it over the Aria Snow. It doesn't beat Airpods (even 2nd gen originals), but those are 200$ and this is 30$. I'll give Moondrop some slack. The app doesn't work for me (it doesn't recognize the device) so I can't turn on game mode or change the EQ, but it's perfectly serviceable without any of those. It's got a bit of a bassy rumble, considerably less shouty than the vast majority of IEMs in its price bracket, and it's a TWS. Mids are okay, same for the highs. For this price, it's the best IEM I've had sound-wise. Battery life is also great- goes far beyond its advertised range. I once had them in for over 6 hours and they didn't die. I use them for like 2 hours a day, and the case's charge usually lasts around a week. I'm not sure why they're billed as sound cancelling. I don't find they really do that unless your volume's pretty high.However, as with all Moondrop products (my left Chu earbud stopped working within 2 months, my Aria started to chip 3 months in), the biggest issue is the build quality and design. The plastic on the buds themselves feel fine, but one of them literally split right open when I dropped it. I still haven't put it back together, but it still plays audio. The tips are great, as per Moondrop's standards, but I feel like they get (at least visibly) oily and nasty fast when wearing them. The charging case is also annoying. I get this is meant to be futuristic, but the case just doesn't work- the magnetic holds aren't as strong as they should be and I find them falling out of the case very often. The fact it doesn't have a top doesn't help.I saw someone on Reddit describe them as disposable Airpods, and that's basically what I'd call them. They're Airpods for kids you don't trust with a $200 pair, they're Airpods you can use when you don't feel comfortable with an expensive gadget, they're Airpods you can buy a ton of and easily swap in and out if they break. Still 4 stars because of how damn cheap they are for that sound quality.  "
"17","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","Chey Vorak Ra","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 10 October 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars","        These are impressive. The tuning is very good, as expected from Moondrop (I own a pair of Arias myself). I find myself enjoying both kpop and rap out of theseThe sound is supposedly basically the same as the Nekocake. Soundstage and imaging are decent, you can make out where the instruments are coming from. Vocals are natural sounding. Bass is powerful, I would think that the average consumer would love it, but it might be too much for some audiophiles I suppose. Treble is energetic but not fatiguing (ahem KZ)The app (I tested it on the Apple App Store) allows you to change the tuning with three presets, but I would just leave it as the reference setting. You can also change the tap functions, but default is fine enough. Just wish I could double tap *either* earbuds to skip and triple tap to go back, like AirPods ProWhich brings me to my comparison to the AirPods Pro Gen 1, which I own. I got these Space Travels since my AirPods had been giving me issues lately, like connectivity and static. Anyway, these sound better than the AirPods right out of the box. The noise cancelling on the Space Travel works for sure, you can feel the ""sucking effect"" in your ear, just like any ANC headphones. Obviously it's not as strong as my Bose 700 or AirPods Pro, but it's effective enough with some music playing. The transparency mode works... but it doesn't feel that much different from when it's off. Nothing will beat the AirPods Pro with Transparency Mode, but these do come a little close to Bose 700 transparency.There is no lid, yes, but the magnets are very strong and you cannot shake out the buds. Dust and lint might get in the case if the buds are out? That's really the flaw here.I just really do wish these had multipoint pairing, where I could use these with both my laptop and phone. Speaking of, when you first connect these to a Windows laptop, they're recognized as like a calling device so the audio quality is terrible and very loud. I think that may just be a Windows thing; they're never good with bluetooth anyway... Pairing is very flawless with these anyway, no complaints  "

"19","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","DAC necesario.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 13 March 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","      Wer Moondrop kennt, weiß, dass sie vor allem im günstigen Bereich echt viel bieten und genau das ist hier auch der Fall!Der Sound ist sehr klar, der Akku hält mir persönlich lang genug, die Qualität ist hochwertig und man hat sogar einen brauchbaren ANC.Sound:Der Sound ist klar, jedoch bietet die App nur 3 vorgefertigte Equalizer, wobei alle recht flach klingen. Möchte man also einen V-Sound, so muss man sich einen externen Equalizer herunterladen, um ein wenig Bass genießen zu können.Akku:Ich persönlich nutze die Kopfhörer in der Bahn auf dem Weg zur und von der Uni (jeweils ca 2h), weshalb ich über die Akkuleistung der Kopfhörer nicht viel sagen kann. Das Case muss ich je nach Nutzung dann alle 1-2 Wochen laden.Qualität:Es ist zwar alles aus Kunststoff, jedoch fühlt dieser sich keineswegs billig an. Alles passt genau wie es soll. Einzig das Reinstecken sowie Herausnehmen der Kopfhörer aus dem Case ist... fragwürdig? Es ist jedenfalls nicht intuitiv und führte einmal dazu, dass meine Kopfhörer auf den Boden gefallen sind.ANC:In der Bahn merkt man auf jeden Fall einen Unterschied: das leise Summen und Brummen verschwindet quasi komplett. Die Gespräche anderer werden nicht unterdrückt, Windgeräusche sogar verstärkt.Verbindung:Obwohl die Kopfhörer Bluetooth 5.3 besitzen, supporten diese leider nur bis zu SBC/AAC (320kBit/s), was mich enttäuscht. Die Verbindung hatte bisher nur zwei mal Probleme und der ""Gaming""-Modus mit einer Latenz von 55ms ist auf jeden Fall brauchbar.Fazit:Meckern auf sehr hohem Niveau! Sound top, super bequem und bringt Spaß - aber an jeder Stelle wurden 1-2 kleine Abstriche gemacht, denen man sich bewusst sein soll.Haben trotzdem meine Sony 1000XM3 abgelöst.    "

"28","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","David","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 6 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        The sound quality is actually very good for TWS and it only costs ~$30. I really have no complaints about that front.What's not so good is the ANC, fit, and the case. The ANC does block a whole lot of noise and the noise it tries to block makes it difficult to tell which direction the noise is coming from. The earphones  stick out quite a lot so you're gonna get a lot of wind noise. And the case while neat, makes it kind of herd to pull the earphones out.Overall, these are good if you're indoors, not so great for being outside.  "
"29","JBL Live Flex ANC True Wireless Stereo Earbuds, Silver  ","David","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Italy on 30 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","        These sound just great considering the cost, far better than original airpods and many others. The noise cancelling and transparency mode work fairly well which is an absolute miracle at this price range. The battery life is fantastic between the earbuds and the case and they come with a good range of ear tip sizes. Unfortunately these have on and off latency issues so watching any sort of video the audio and visuals will be off by about half a second which is pretty considerable, even in low latency game mode. This latency issue can usually be resolved either by toggling between the two latency modes or by placing them in the case and reconnecting. It usually comes back within ten or fifteen minutes so that makes watching movies with them pretty unpleasant. Overall these are a really great value and if you plan on just using them for music or tuning out an airplane they are a definite buy. If however you intent to use these for movies and television i would maybe look elswhere.  "

Really unusable when moving around a lot while at work or eating as the seal keeps breaking as my jaw moves. Case is also finicky as I have to play around with it to get it in the case but the magnets do a good job of holding them in.I would suggest the 1more stylish (using wavelet , autoeq to 1more dual driver, bass boosted) instead but it may just be my ears.

Nachdem ich testweise durch Sh, Eh, und Heh gewechselt habe - das sind die Ansagen für ANC, Regulär und Transparenz Modus - ist der rechte Hörer in einer der Funktionen hängen geblieben und lässt sich nicht mehr bedienen. Auch das zurückstecken ins Case, sowie der Versuch die Kopfhörer nach Anleitung zurückzusetzen haben nichts gebracht. Schade.    "

Can be heard more clearly if you do a 20-20kHz sweep test. Cannot believe the same issue still exist for moondrop wireless earphones since I returned the nekocake for the same reason. Please fix it if it was caused by firmware issues.  "
