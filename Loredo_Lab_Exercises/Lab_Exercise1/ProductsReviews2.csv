"1","John","Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars","        I have had Apple TVs previously which are ok but the remotes can be a bit fickle. The Fire Stick has an easy to use remote which controls the TV volume as well.  The set up process was easy and fairly quick. It works well with our Wi Fi. Very happy with this purchase  "

"3","John","Reviewed in Spain on 24 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        It is an upgrade from the ""lite"" model  that I had before and not only for the 4k which I do not use, but for speed and stability. I am using it with the Ethernet  adapter so I have not used the wifi capability yet.  "
