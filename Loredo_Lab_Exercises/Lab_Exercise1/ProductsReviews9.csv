"2","Johnny Lin","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Am very sad at having to return this for a refund.  Prior to purchase, the indication I had from initial internet research was that Tidal Music was supported.  However, on receiving the Echo and setting it up, I found that Tidal Music is NOT supported.  More detailed internet research on the issue confirmed that.Misled, I think, by how skewed internet results are towards the US market, such that I initially didn't spot the relatively few references to lack of support in Australia.I really don't understand why though?  I'm a long time subscriber to Tidal Music via my phone / iPad / PC, and Tidal is very straightforwardly made available direct to the Australian consumer.Anyway, what value to the Echo if one can't listen to the music one is paying for?

"3","Johnny Lin","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I used Google Nest Minis for months to years before deciding to switch to Amazon Echoes. I gave it a few months with the Echoes which seem more customisable than the Google ones which is nice, but the Echoes really started to show their cracks. The number one issue is I often have to repeat my command because it doesn't pick up that I'm saying ""Alexa"". I originally used ""Computer"" which had the same problem - the mic is just not as sensitive as the Nest Minis, and it seems to want me to pause after saying ""Alexa"". You can say ""Alexa, turn the lights on"" but not ""Alexa turn the lights on"" (note the comma).Another issue (that I could potentially overlook if the wake word worked) was that I can't use ""Alexa, turn the light on for 5 minutes"" unless I specifically make a routine (ie. a set of actions) that works to do this, and the Nest Minis did this naturally without any preparation. Worse, you have to do for each increment of time that you plan to use in future - if you create a routine for 5 minutes, you need a separate routine for 10 minutes, etc. I put up with this for months and eventually gave up on it about a week ago.The sound from the echo is really good, and the sound from the echo dot is very below average. If I was going to stick with the echoes, I'd buy an echo for each room, maybe even if I didn't plan to play music from it. If I really didn't care, the echo dot's sound would be fine really, but the comparison between the two is a huge difference. It's like comparing telephone/radio quality to CD quality.  "
"4","JW","Reviewed in Australia on 10 May 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Hrmmm. These have been a disappointment… I previously had the cylinder shaped echos working in a stereo pair with sub… these have honestly been a downgrade in reliability - audio quality doesn’t seem any better either. Let me share my experience. Using these as a stereo pair plus sub.BUGS. BUGS BUGS!!!Triggering Alexa has become MUCH harder.Music just stops playing randomly all the time.Music drops out and you only hear the base track on one of the speakers.Can’t play radio anymore, just stops after 1-5 mins.The fabric on-top is a PITA - easy to get dirty if you manually adjust volume in the kitchen... Speaking of, if you press volume up more then 5 times in a row. The speaker pair crashes, music stops.The led ring being on the bottom is a PITA. With the old echos you could easily see that she was listening and the LEDs were on top.With these, the LED listening ring is hard to see behind other small items on the table. Sometimes you speak out an entire command to reaslise she’s not listening.All in all. For whatever reason. My old echos were 98% reliable. These new ones were purchased at full price and have been a severe disappointment. I’m hoping the bugs get ironed out ASAP, as my smart home relies heavily on my Alexa devices performing as expected.Don’t buy unless on special. Helps make the sting hurt less when they wig out all the time.  "
"5","Avatar","Reviewed in Australia on 6 January 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        its loud, its constant and it drives you mad.If only there was a way to disable it. Communications settings for device greyed out.It's a known 'feature' that Amazon wont fix.  "
"6","Ian","Reviewed in Australia on 27 June 2022","2.0 out of 5 stars","        mic just stopped working after 18 months bit disappointing and not covered under warranty. The mic needed to be more powerful in any case  "
"7","Fibbs","Reviewed in Australia on 31 December 2023","2.0 out of 5 stars","        No only does Alexia talk too much, I have to upgrade to premium Amazon music because it won't work with Tidal or YouTube music. It won't play anything you ask for music wise unless you have the premium package even though I have Amazon Prime. I have a xiaomi speaker that is way easier to use and talks less!  "
"8","Nick","Reviewed in Australia on 13 July 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm really disappointed with the new Echo. While the so-called premium sound really doesn't sound much better than my prior Echo, that hasn't turned into as much of a disappointment as the microphone. I sit four or five feet away from it and it only wakes to my voice perhaps 60% of the time. In fact, the echo I have in the next room and down the hall wakes nearly 100% of the time and responds while the new one does nothing. It is incredibly frustrating! With the new echo, it doesn't matter if I'm right next to it, raising my voice over the top of it, shouting at it, or repeating Alexa 20 times in different ways or volume levels! It's hard to express how bad it is!  "
"9","Sasi111","Reviewed in Australia on 25 April 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I was disappointed to learn from the Amazon support centre I could only connect one Speaker to my  Samsung QLED Smart TV. This was despite the fact there’s a video on You Tube showing that it is possible.  "
"10","GayleH","Reviewed in Australia on 19 November 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars","        I had really high hopes for this but it rarely responds to my voice and sound quality is poor to fair. Not sure why Amazon would release this when it's an inferior product. Our Echo Dots work great, I was after something for a bigger room but there's really no need, and I certainly wouldn't recommend this. It's basically a very pretty round ball with blue lights, it's that's what you're after then this is for you!!! If you want a good speaker, buy something else. If you want a good unit to run Alexa, stick with the Dot. Honestly, don't buy this. It is just plain useless and won't pick up your voice.  "
