"1","Amazon Ethernet Adapter for Amazon Fire TV Devices","Sean","Reviewed in Australia on 9 December 2023","This is my third of these. Getting FireTV to Ethernet really improves everything.","4.5 out of 5 stars"
"2","Amazon Ethernet Adapter for Amazon Fire TV Devices","Chris","Reviewed in Australia on 4 October 2023","It works, but is a clunky product that adds to the cable mess. I'd much rather a fire stick model with integrated Ethernet port, even if it cost the same as these two (stick+adapter) combined. Laptop USB to Ethernet adapter is tiny, why does this need to be large with an extra short cable?Works so 4 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
