current state-of-the-art methods for the calculation of vulnerability indices include equal weight percentile ranking and the use of principal component analysis (pca). the weighted vulnerability index methodology proposed in this study offers an advantage over others in the literature by considering health outcomes in the calculation process. the resulting vulnerability percentiles more clearly align population sensitivity and adaptive capacity with health risks. the temporal and spatial resolutions of the indices enable national monitoring on a scale never before seen across australia. additionally, we show that a weekly temporal resolution can be used to identify spikes in vulnerability due to changes in relative national environmental exposure.",2024-03-22

current state-of-the-art methods for the calculation of vulnerability indices include equal weight percentile ranking and the use of principal component analysis (pca). the weighted vulnerability index methodology proposed in this study offers an advantage over others in the literature by considering health outcomes in the calculation process. the resulting vulnerability percentiles more clearly align population sensitivity and adaptive capacity with health risks. the temporal and spatial resolutions of the indices enable national monitoring on a scale never before seen across australia. additionally, we show that a weekly temporal resolution can be used to identify spikes in vulnerability due to changes in relative national environmental exposure.",2024-03-22

current state-of-the-art methods for the calculation of vulnerability indices include equal weight percentile ranking and the use of principal component analysis (pca). the weighted vulnerability index methodology proposed in this study offers an advantage over others in the literature by considering health outcomes in the calculation process. the resulting vulnerability percentiles more clearly align population sensitivity and adaptive capacity with health risks. the temporal and spatial resolutions of the indices enable national monitoring on a scale never before seen across australia. additionally, we show that a weekly temporal resolution can be used to identify spikes in vulnerability due to changes in relative national environmental exposure.",2024-03-22

a longitudinal overview of resource interactions is mapped through bayesian network analysis of moodle activity logs from  students. this analysis identifies early resource engagement as a predictive indicator of continued engagement while also suggesting that the new incentives disproportionately benefit highly engaged students. focus group discussions complement this analysis, providing insights into student perceptions of the pedagogical changes and the module design. these qualitative findings underscore the challenge of sustaining engagement through the new incentives and highlight the importance of communication in blended learning environments.
our paper introduces an interpretable and actionable model for student engagement, which integrates objective, data-driven analysis with students' perspectives. this model provides educators with a tool to evaluate and improve instructional strategies. by demonstrating the effectiveness of our mixed methods approach in capturing the intricacies of student behaviour in digital learning environments, we underscore the model's potential to improve online pedagogical practices across diverse educational settings.",2024-03-13
