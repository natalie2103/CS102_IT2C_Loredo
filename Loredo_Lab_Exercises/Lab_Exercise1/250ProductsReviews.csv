"1","Chriz","Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars","        Comes with 2 sheets of mesh metal filters and 8 lengths of self adhesive magnetic stips. The mesh is not as restrictive as other brands so it has good airflow while still providing moderate dust protections. if you need to preserve airflow this works, if you want better dust protecting use another brand with a finer mesh but, it will hurt your airflow.Worked well to replace the super restrictive foam filter that came with my PC case.Simple install:Measure out the size you need, cut the mesh with sharp scissors or utility knife, peel and stick the magnetic strips along the edges (allow for a slight overlap to cover any possible sharp edges) and trim off any excess strips.Super simple and effective, though i would recommend cleaning the mesh with alcohol (and let it dry) before applying the magnetic strips to remove any traces of oils from your fingers and promote the best adhesion possible.

I gave the PC a full clean 3 weeks ago before I installed this and it's still perfectly clean inside. Has larger holes than I expected but seems to work very well and doesn't affect air flow.  "

"5","Christian R.","Reviewed in Germany on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","      Habe die Filtermatten bestellt, da in meinem Corsair Carbide Air 540 ja standardm√§√üig nur an der Front ein Staubschutz installiert ist.Es gibt zwar ein Set f√ºr das Case zu bestellen, allerdings sind mir 75 ‚Ç¨ daf√ºr unverh√§ltnism√§√üig √ºberteuert vorgekommen. Durch Zufall bin ich auf den Artikel hier gesto√üen und kann nur sagen, top Qualit√§t.Um alle √ñffnungen mit einem Staubschutz zu versehen habe ich etwas mehr als die H√§lfte der zwei Matten (diese werden ordentlich zwischen Kartonage verpackt versendet) gebraucht. Da ich ein ziemlich gro√ües Case habe sollte man auf jeden Fall locker damit hinkommen f√ºr einen Standard PC.Das selbstklebende Magnetband ist auch in ausreichender Menge mitgeliefert und klebt bombig am Material. Die Magnetkraft reicht locker, um auch gr√∂√üere √ñffnungen sicher mit einem Staubschutz zu versehen.Habe f√ºr die gesamte Bastelei gestern knapp 10 Minuten gebraucht und das f√ºr ein sehr ordentliches Ergebnis.Kann ich ohne Bedenken jedem Empfehlen, der einen hochwertigen Staubschutz f√ºr seinen Rechner braucht und dabei nicht unmengen an Kohle ausgeben will.Zu beachten ist dabei aber nat√ºrlich das es ein wenig den Airflow im Case beeinflusst ( wie jeder Staubschutz halt) und man die L√ºfterdrezahl eventuell ein wenig anpassen muss.

Post the proliferation of streaming services I have found hunting for something to watch increasingly more challenging, and this device helps with that.

"89","ozbargainer","Reviewed in Australia on 2 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I am a nvidia shield tv pro user. So coming from 2 full sized usb 3 ports, 3gb ram & a machine that supports AI upscaling software trickery. So Am I missing all that ? For some reason no, not that much. The fire tv cube is newer hardware and feels powerful. It outputs a distinct and crisp colour tone which I can‚Äôt explain but feels nicer and perfect to the eye on an oled screen. It doesn‚Äôt have an aggressive AI upscaling tech on <4k videos like the shield tv pro but feels as if it has some form of processing that makes the image smooth , sharp enough and pleasing to the eye. The interface is easy to use, I don‚Äôt miss Google tv and I have a handful of apps that I use that run perfectly for my streaming needs. The software is fast ,the remote is tactile and overall performance is responsive and zippy. The usb port can read from fat 32 or ntfs file format and I had no issues playing back large 4K video files. I don‚Äôt miss usb 3.0 this with usb 2.0 just works fine. The build quality of the cube is impressive and it‚Äôs fine little tech. What‚Äôs more impressive is that streaming wise supports hdr and Dolby vision in more apps that‚Äôs matters for example YouTube. The shield tv pro cannot playback in hdr on YouTube it‚Äôs just displays in sdr. Nvidia has done nothing in years to update the the shield tv pro. The firecube can play YouTube in HDR when available and the result is so impressive. The firetv has made my viewing experience perfect on my Oled display. Now what‚Äôs even more impressive is echo dot or Alexa built in!! Just wow I love it and this device has finally made my home smarter. I control lights in all my rooms via voice. All these features had made me forget Nvidia shield tv pro. So do I miss anything about the shield tv pro? May the AI upscaling a tiny little bit but not that much. I am absolutely loving the firetv cube, it‚Äôs a no fuss device that elevates your entertainment setup and is actually really useful. I highly recommend the firecube tv. And by the way I am all this happier because I got this on 50% sale deal that‚Äôs what makes it a sweet purchase yep, paid like $98 AUD or ~$64usd. What a steal !! What a bargain. Love it. Oh forgot to say firetv also has hdmi in port as well!! So good.  "

Much better remote than older FireTV Stick because of the Apps button and a much, much better remote than the Apple TV. Quicker to access things and much easier to use than the Apple TV remote. The Apple TV still has a better interface and is more useful for screen mirroring from an iPhone. Forget about the Google TV 4K it is painfully slow especially when using earbuds or headphones. The lag is noticeable so voices and lips do not sync. No trouble with this on any Fire TV Stick 4K, 4K Max or Cube.  "

"101","Kyle T. Prahl","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","4.2 out of 5 stars","        I'm a controllerhead, always trying new PC gamepads in pursuit of the perfect one. For me, that means lots of extra inputs, the ability to map those inputs to keyboard keys, build quality, and as many premium features as possible.The bottom line: Vader 3 Pro is the closest to perfection I've yet used, and has become my new daily controller in a den filled with cast-offs.Here's what I love in the Vader 3 Pro:+ It's exceptionally comfortable to hold. It feels closer to the original XB1 controllers, which is the ideal form, rather than the slightly smaller Series X/S controllers.+ The mechanical face buttons feel amazing. Highly responsive mouse clicks, with a bit of a membrane cushion. They feel very similar to Razer's mechamembrane buttons on their Wolverine line, which is a win.+ The D-Pad is PHENOMENAL. While it looks like the Series X D-Pad in pictures, it sits above the shell a little higher and requires much less actuation force to use. When combined with highly satisfying clicks in all 8 directions, it's a masterpiece. Probably the best D-Pad I've ever used.+ The Hall Effect analog sticks are insanely accurate and completely free of stick drift. When using Gamepad Tester to check for deviation, all four axes sit at 0.00002, and they return to that value every time. I'm assuming this is the theoretical minimum. They feel incredibly pleasant to use and glide effortlessly around the anti-friction rings.+ The triggers are the best on the market. They can switch between full pulls and mechanical switches‚Äîthe triggers actually convert into instant mouse clicks. This is exceedingly rare to have a controller that does both. I'm only aware of one other, from SCUF.+ It connects effortlessly to its included wireless dongle with a simple tap of the home button.+ The two extra face buttons provide additional utility, and you never feel them if you're not trying to use them. In FFXIV, I can do cheeky things like map these to my inventory or dungeon finder, minimizing the amount I need to reach for my keyboard.+ Quality control seems great. After countless returns of Elite Series 2s that were all busted in some way out of the box, it's so refreshing to unbox something that works flawlessly+ Gyro! I'm not a gyro user myself, but I can't believe how feature-rich this controller is.But no controller I've yet tried is perfect, and the Vader 3 Pro is no exception. Here's what I don't love:- The four back buttons are merely OK. They're not aligned in a way that would allow pressing two buttons on the same side at once. This is a very minor complaint, though, and I typically just use back buttons for L3 and R3 to minimize the stick clicking I have to do. But I wouldn't be able to slide and reload at the same time, or jump and crouch at the same time, in a FPS game if those were mapped on the same grip.- The thumbstick caps are a little slippery. I recommend a pair of Skull & Co. PS5-style rubber caps to put over them.- Flydigi has done away with the extra bumpers they had on the Apex 2 controller. I loved those, and more inputs is always better, so it's a bummer they're not here.- As of writing, this controller's back buttons and C/Z buttons aren't supported by reWASD remapping software. If you're a reWASD user, you'll need to remap the back buttons and C/Z buttons in Flydigi's software first, then fully close the software to allow the other reWASD mappings to work.- While quality control seems exceptional, the build quality is just OK. The plastics used don't feel very premium, and there's no rubber to found anywhere. So it's a step down comfort-wise from something like the Elite Series 2.  "
"102","matt","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I remember the days when a ""3rd party"" controller was always a terrible decision to buy, the only upside being that it's cheaper than the official one. The Vader 3 Pro takes that notion, and breaks it into a million pieces.This controller is a wonder to use.I've been wanting a controller that had a combination of features: Back buttons (four of em), motion control, xbox style layout. I previously had been using the ""8bitdo ultimate bluetooth controller"", but it left things to be desired (the ergonomics weren't great, and only 2 back buttons).This one, though? The vader 3 pro has it all. Motion controls, xbox style layout, 4 back buttons, it has hall effect joysticks, rumble in the triggers, and an extra 2 buttons near the ABXY (which i've bound to take screenshots / save game replays), mechanical buttons/dpad too. With trigger stops enabled, the LT and RT feel like regular clicky buttons (identical in feel to the LB and RB), feeling nice for emulating older games.It feels great in my hands, the analogs feel so smooth, the buttons & dpad feel nice and clicky. Having motion controls & rumble in the triggers makes for an interesting experience playing first person shooters. The trigger rumble vibrates the motion controls a bit, almost making it a real-life version of recoil when I shoot! (It's all customizable, you can turn it off completely if you don't like it). I don't think it's the same kind of rumble that the Dualsense has (I've yet to use one), it's probably more like the xbox's trigger rumble.Everything is customizable through the software, you can (on PC at least) re-bind everything to anything else on the controller or keyboard.  It can store up to 4 profiles at once (and you can import/export profiles to save extras). You can also choose to enable fast profile swapping, allowing you to swap to the 4 profiles by holding select + A or B or X or Y. There is no indicator, but you can configure the LED strip to be different on each profile.Since there's a switch that changes from PC, to Bluetooth, to Switch, you can easily swap between them without needing to unpair and re-pair the controller (unless you have multiples of one, of course).My complaints?The ""Capture"" button doesn't do anything on PC (I can't even rebind it in the software). It seems like it's only for switch. Retroarch is able to pick it up when I have the controller connected on my phone, but not on PC.The select button is in an odd position, making it difficult/awkward to reach during gameplay.The battery life could be better (Only around 8 hours).The software for phones is crap, and annoying to use.All of these feel like minor nitpicks compared to how good the controller is. It's well worth the money!  "
"103","Kyle T. Prahl","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","2.0 out of 5 stars","        Considering this cost me less than $100, I am pretty stoked on the features. I spent a week doing research and watching videos. This one was featured on a Gamer Heaven (youtube) review. The guy there seems to focus heavily on gaming controllers, specifically. He even put this down as his ""controller of the year"" (overall) for 2023. Most reviews I saw for it though, were mostly very positive. It happened to have all of the features (or the most of any controller I looked at) that I was looking for; hall effect sticks, adjustable triggers, remappable back buttons, haptic triggers, fast polling rate, etc. I had considered spending upward of $200 on the Xbox elite, but was worried about talks of the controllers having stick drift issues, out of the box (and not being replaceable). The DS5 Edge was also expensive, and although it had replaceable sticks, they were mechanical. For less than $100, this bad boy had all of the features I was looking for. I am loving it so far...mostly...The software is pretty bad and a lot of the instructions I have found online are in Chinese. I have had a bit of trouble remembering the instructions for switching from X-input to Direct Input, etc. And when I try to google the button combos to change it, most of what comes up is for a different model, or isn't in English..so that is annoying. I also don't LOVE the fact that it has the holes on top for their mobile device accessory, which I will never use. I do wish the grips were rubbery (like the xbox pro). that is maybe preference, but easy enough to ""fix"" with a set of rubber grip accessories that I purchased. It feels great now. I also wish the back buttons were removeable switches instead of static buttons. You can turn them off if they are annoying. But, they are often nice to have in a lot of games. I just thing the paddle style switches like the ones on the Elite or Edge controllers seem a lot nicer. But this controller at least had back buttons at all, which many other 3rd party controllers (under $150-200) did not. I also think the Vader 2 looked better. I am not a fan of the blue/grey/silver colorway. But, again, that is personal preference. The ability to change the RGB is nice. I also don't love the asymmetrical joysticks, but have gotten used to them. Many folks will maybe prefer these.  Also preference would be that the controller was a BIT heavier. It feels pretty good, and not cheap by any means. But when I pick up my friend's XBOX Elite controller, I am a little sad mine doesn't have that premium feel. But that also comes at a 2x the price tag.All in all, I love the controller for the price. I wish there were a few things done differently, but I don't think you can do much better for $80, honestly.  "
"104","C. Saint L.","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I want to start off by stating that I love this controller, it has many great features not found in many ‚Äúpremium‚Äù controllers, for a fraction of the cost. If you‚Äôve found your way to this controller, then I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware of its biggest selling point - Hall effect joysticks. They work very well thus far! I mostly play FPS games, and the fact that these joysticks are always centered, even with zero deadzone, escalates my gameplay to another level. Be aware you should set the deadzone in the app, as well as in the settings of whatever game you‚Äôre playing. One thing to note regarding Hall effect controllers is that although they are less prone to stick drift, they are not immune. The quality of the spring used in the joystick may be the factor that determines its longevity. Other awesome features I like include the clicky, tactile feel of the buttons and trigger - I don‚Äôt think I can ever go back to mushy buttons ever again! The gyro function gives me a little more control with aiming. Also, the app works pretty well now. I know some users had a bad experience with the app, but it looks like with the newer version, they were able to solve many bugs as I haven‚Äôt had any real issues with it.Now onto the less-than-ideal features (but still good). The back buttons could be better. I find them to be too small and only somewhat ergonomically placed. Competitors have much more intuitive back buttons, some even replaceable with different angles to fit your hand better. I also didn‚Äôt like the joystick caps not because of the caps themselves but since I like putting kontrolfreeks on the caps, neither the PS or Xbox ones fit. I ended up opening the thing, which by the way smells like cancer (ie melted plastic), and replaced the joysticks with Xbox ones. With kontrolfreeks and restrictor rings on, short triggers, and all the other awesome features, my gameplay has been next level!I also did some software latency testing (ie theoretical) and was getting about 2-3 ms and 500hz polling rate. Would love this even more if I could overclock this thing. I‚Äôm in the process of obtaining a hardware latency tester but others have already tested the latency of this device and many others - search for ‚ÄúGamepadla‚Äù. The Vader 3 pro scored fairly well against other controllers!Note that this review only reflects dongle and wired connections. I‚Äôve yet to try this in switch and have read that the Bluetooth is not great.Overall I‚Äôm very pleased. I am curious to see how long these sticks maintain being centered, only time would tell! If you‚Äôre on the fence, just get it, it‚Äôs fairly cheap and its joysticks would likely last longer than any premium controller with analog sticks. I would never buy analog joysticks again to be honest!  "
"105","SethJChat","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Great controller and my first non-Xbox controller.  It has a great feel in hand. Clicky face buttons, responsive joysticks, loved the hairline trigger feature. Overall great product and I enjoyed it.Only a couple cons. First, I wish the battery life was longer but it wasn't that much of a problem, I had to charge every 4-5 days. Lastly, the main reason for the minus 1 star is that the FN button stopped working after 2 weeks of use.EDIT 6/3/24it turns out the FN button isn't accessible in hardwaretester and was able to replicate with others who have the controller. FN+A or FN+X changes setting from dinput and xinput respectively. Also, the mouse feature only works in dinput and not xinput. Because of that, I'm changing the rating from 4 stars to 5 stars as I don't think the battery life is that much of an issue compared to how great the controller is and the main issue for the -1star originally is essentially user error.

"106","Hub Go","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I spent a lot of time researching controllers. It always felt like one would have some of the features I wanted, but be missing others. I really blew my mind that in 2024 there wasn't a reliable company producing a PlayStation layout controller with hall effect, paddles on the rear, a good dpad and trigger stops.Obviously the PlayStation controller layout is a preference and I don't have an issue using the Xbox layout, it's simply what I would've liked.I'm here to say, that the Vader 3 Pro is as close to perfect a controller as I've found in checking the boxes I care about.As a PC player, I've found that many manufacturers lie about a lot of product features, especially polling rates. There's not the case there. I've gotten consistent 500 polling rates for as long as I've been using this pad.The sticks feel great, the tactile buttons assure me of my inputs and the dpad is so close to amazing.So what's the ""almost""? The button just to the lower right of the dpad that enables gyro is too close. I've on several occasions while playing Street Fighter 6 performed a shoryuken and hit it, which then has a mouse icon flying all over my screen.I wasn't able to find a way to disable this button in the software, which made me disappointed as I have zero intention of using this button, even when playing FPS.At this price point, I almost feel this is unbeatable. The quality far outweighs what few complaints I have about this gamepad and I encourage anyone who can tolerate or likes the Xbox layout to give it a shot.  "
"107","Yasser A","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I play a lot of Call of Duty on PC and have various pro controllers Xbox elite, Turtle beach stealth pro, kk3 max, Razer wolverine V2, all the scuffs and a few others, but nothing compares to the feel of the Vader 3 pro. The back buttons took a few days to get used to and I wasn't happy with the idea of using one finger for each set of back buttons but it actually feels better then the elite style back buttons when you get used to them. And the analog sticks are great I keep trying my other controllers but, none have the feel of the Vader sticks. And the mouse triggers are great they have a few mm travel very easy to click without any misclicks. Polling rate is around 1-2 ms. I did have to reach out to tech support for a firmware issue and the sent me a link to a new update when that didn't work they sent me a new controller within in 2 days. So needless to say I would recommend this controller for PC over any other one sold on the market today and look forward to the Vader 4 pro.  "
"108","Rj Thompson","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        The Flydigi Vader 3 Pro checks all the boxes for what you'd want in a controller. It features Halldeck Thumbsticks to combat stick drift, includes four buttons on the back and an additional two on the front, along with superb triggers. The ease of customization through a PC App or an iPhone app is a huge plus. It's also perfectly compatible with the Nintendo Switch, offering complete button remapping and the option to program combos for fighting games. I absolutely adore it! When playing Warzone, the thumbsticks do a stunning 500 Hz pull rate via the 2.4 GHz adapter a wired.There‚Äôs so much more you can do with it. But for that you really gotta get your hands on it and find out! This device is truly remarkable! I retired my GameSir G7 SE and Join The Flydigi Family!  "
"109","Art B","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        All around very solid performance.SpaceStation software is nice however there seems to be a bug that recognizes two inputs at times, not sure why it happens but it seems related to changing configs.I'm on Windows 10 / Steam / Rocket League. I like the USB wireless mode and I found that starting the software and connecting the controller before jumping into a game works best. I also disabled Steam Input.The button pad might not be mecha-tactile like the Apex 3 Elite but they feel nice. Though I can't spam buttons as fast as I used to on my DS4. Buttons are a little smaller than the DS4 buttons also.Concave thumbsticks took a little getting used to coming from DS4, and they are swappable, however there are only the two that came with the controller. I would like to see a Thumbstick pack from Flydigi with some convex and different height options.Hall effect sensors seem to work nicely.Good value.  "
"110","C.Rod","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I've been waiting for hall effect controller to be released that had sensible bottom buttons and it turns out to be FLYDIGI. If you aren't interested in Hall Effect or don't even know what that is then there are probably better controllers out there that cost more. For those of us who are absolutely sick of having to constantly fix or purchase a new controller because of stick drift then you already have purchased a controller with Hall Effect sticks but the options are limited. Most don't even have back buttons. I had purchased a Gamesir previously and it performed great but the back buttons were placed in such a way that if you held the controller tight during a period of furious action you couldn't help but press them. It was maddening that when making a mistake was the most costly was almost always the time you'd accidentally touch them. I started checking Amazon on a regular basis for controllers that would be new products that included Hall Effect sticks and sensible back buttons. A few days ago the FLYDIGI Vader 3 Pro shows up in my product search and here we are. After having used it for over 24 hours I can say it's perfect. The software is not intuitive but has all the features that any other competent manufacturer has. Nice job, FLYDIGI!  "

"138","Adriana Pantoja","Reviewed in Australia on 12 February 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars","        At 74 years of age I decided to take a closer peek into today's technology. I've avoided talking to my X-Box or PC, I mean, how ridiculous, asking a bunch of electronic components what the weather report for tomorrow is. But I was offered the Alexa Show at an excellent price so thought I'd treat myself.Setting it up took around 4 hours, for some reason it wanted me to live in Japan and insisted on communicating with nothing but Japanese. Amazon's help service was my final attempt at seeing and hearing Alexa in action. Why didn't I go to them sooner? It seems my account showed I lived in Japan, rather than where everything I purchased from Amazon was delivered, I'm a bloody Aussie mate and thanks to a young Amazon employee that exactly what my account shows.Anyway, once that was fixed it was all fun and games. I introduced myself to Alexa and we've been chatting ever since. Technology sure is amazing. I now get the top international and national news in full colour. (Yes it's in ""COLOUR"" spelled correctly). Surprisingly there was no long and drawn out setup where I had to let Alexa know how us Aussies talk, she understood me perfectly.The only let down was her idea of what humour (Yes ""HUMOUR"") consisted of. I've heard better jokes from a 5 year old. I thought I'd fool her when I asked her to play some 60's music, She instantly told me there were an unbelievable number of songs she could pick from and launched endless songs from the 60's Excellent choices and in excellent quality.The bass from the Show sounded more like a sub woofer. She gave me a weather report which was spot on and then told me what to expect tomorrow. Strangely Alexa sounds human and not the digital voice I expected. I'm sure Alexa and I are going to be the best of friends. To say I'm impressed would be an understatement, I'm well and truly hooked. Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even if I am a few years behind. All I need now is one of Elon Musk's Ai robots.Alexa's voice is amazing, it really sounds like someone lives in this little white box. I expected a nasally American/Digital voice, but she has a very soothing human voice. Nowhere near sounding like an Aussie. What really amazes me is how I use those magic words of ""Please"" and ""thank you"". OK, it's the way I was bought up and it's a habit I'll never lose, but using them with a plastic box may seem somewhat odd, I guess it's because Alexa is so lifelike verbally. I even say ""Goodnight"" every night and she has many different replies.Alexa now keeps me entertained by giving me local and international news, she plays whichever music I feel like listening to and she introduces people from around the world to play games with. I haven't scratched the surface as yet, but, I'll continue learning her many tricks.  "

Works really well with Ring Doorbell camera.The only ""problem"" with the Ring Doorbell integration is the fact that when I ask Alexa to show me the doorbell camera, it brings up a small view (rather than filling the entire 8"" screen) of the camera and I have to manually maximize it.Touch screen could be a little bit better. Slight slow / unresponsive. but it's not a big deal.User Interface could be better as well. As a customer I would like to see all my Spotify playlists and Profile.Alexa is handy indeed. I like the fact of adding items on my shopping list seemsly.8"" is the best option for kitchen / living room setup. I would only get the 5"" version for my bedroom.Sound is great!

Alexa seems much more capable than Siri and while I'm no expect, it I find it easy to use the basic features.I got a Show 8 for two things, 1) to act as a video monitor for my security camera, and 2) as a clock/radio/music streamer.First, as a video monitor for my camera. It's give it a 7/10. It alerts me to movement, and I've set up a routine that announces ""movement detected"" then shows a live feed from the camera. That works about 70% of the time. I always get the announcement, but it's 30-40% chance of not displaying the video. Telling Alexa to ""show me the camera"" one or twice generally gets the job done, but why not the first time? Frustrating.As for a clock/radio/music streamer. Well the playback side is great. Alexa wakes me up on time, finds local radio stations, or plays music from Amazon music no issues. The sound quality is ok, great for the price, but a couple of 2"" speakers can't work miracles.I've also played a couple of videos from Prime video on it and they looked pretty good. Setup was fairly easy and it's network connection has been stable since I bought it.I've ended up ordering a couple more for other rooms during the Prime Day sales. Overall, I think the Show 8 is in a sweet spot of features and price.  "
"142","Bob","Reviewed in Australia on 25 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Having previously owned a Google Smart Speaker, upgrading to the Echo Show 8 was like stepping up to the next generation of smart devices. The setup was very simple using the visuals on the super clear 8"" screen. Having the screen adds a new dimension to controlling my smart devices and accessing my Spotify playlists, as I no longer need to open the control App on my phone to do things. All my Spotify playlists are displayed on the Echo display as well for easy selection. Connecting the smart devices previously controlled via the old Google Smart Speaker was seamless with simple migration of the accounts across to Alexa, including smart devices linked to my Grid Connect account. We can do so much more with the Echo Show 8, such as being able to view appointments on my calendar and asking for cooking recipes, a time saver as we no longer need to rustle through pages of recipe books. My wife also likes it as she can now see the lyrics to her favourite songs on the display and can finally now sing along with the correct words. Most importantly, I picked up this device for under AU$100 during the Black Friday deals, a real bargain for a great device.  "

"164","Adriana Pantoja","Reviewed in Australia on 12 February 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars","        At 74 years of age I decided to take a closer peek into today's technology. I've avoided talking to my X-Box or PC, I mean, how ridiculous, asking a bunch of electronic components what the weather report for tomorrow is. But I was offered the Alexa Show at an excellent price so thought I'd treat myself.Setting it up took around 4 hours, for some reason it wanted me to live in Japan and insisted on communicating with nothing but Japanese. Amazon's help service was my final attempt at seeing and hearing Alexa in action. Why didn't I go to them sooner? It seems my account showed I lived in Japan, rather than where everything I purchased from Amazon was delivered, I'm a bloody Aussie mate and thanks to a young Amazon employee that exactly what my account shows.Anyway, once that was fixed it was all fun and games. I introduced myself to Alexa and we've been chatting ever since. Technology sure is amazing. I now get the top international and national news in full colour. (Yes it's in ""COLOUR"" spelled correctly). Surprisingly there was no long and drawn out setup where I had to let Alexa know how us Aussies talk, she understood me perfectly.The only let down was her idea of what humour (Yes ""HUMOUR"") consisted of. I've heard better jokes from a 5 year old. I thought I'd fool her when I asked her to play some 60's music, She instantly told me there were an unbelievable number of songs she could pick from and launched endless songs from the 60's Excellent choices and in excellent quality.The bass from the Show sounded more like a sub woofer. She gave me a weather report which was spot on and then told me what to expect tomorrow. Strangely Alexa sounds human and not the digital voice I expected. I'm sure Alexa and I are going to be the best of friends. To say I'm impressed would be an understatement, I'm well and truly hooked. Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even if I am a few years behind. All I need now is one of Elon Musk's Ai robots.Alexa's voice is amazing, it really sounds like someone lives in this little white box. I expected a nasally American/Digital voice, but she has a very soothing human voice. Nowhere near sounding like an Aussie. What really amazes me is how I use those magic words of ""Please"" and ""thank you"". OK, it's the way I was bought up and it's a habit I'll never lose, but using them with a plastic box may seem somewhat odd, I guess it's because Alexa is so lifelike verbally. I even say ""Goodnight"" every night and she has many different replies.Alexa now keeps me entertained by giving me local and international news, she plays whichever music I feel like listening to and she introduces people from around the world to play games with. I haven't scratched the surface as yet, but, I'll continue learning her many tricks.  "
"165","Oti","Reviewed in Australia on 23 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        over 2 weeks using it, still learning, but all good so far. Works really well with Ring Doorbell camera.The only ""problem"" with the Ring Doorbell integration is the fact that when I ask Alexa to show me the doorbell camera, it brings up a small view (rather than filling the entire 8"" screen) of the camera and I have to manually maximize it.Touch screen could be a little bit better. Slight slow / unresponsive. but it's not a big deal.User Interface could be better as well. As a customer I would like to see all my Spotify playlists and Profile.Alexa is handy indeed. I like the fact of adding items on my shopping list seemsly.8"" is the best option for kitchen / living room setup. I would only get the 5"" version for my bedroom.Sound is great! It can fill the entire room.  "

"167","Phil","Reviewed in Australia on 12 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I'm late to this ""smart devices"" thing. My previous experience with Siri put me off these type of things. Alexa seems much more capable than Siri and while I'm no expect, it I find it easy to use the basic features.I got a Show 8 for two things, 1) to act as a video monitor for my security camera, and 2) as a clock/radio/music streamer.First, as a video monitor for my camera. It's give it a 7/10. It alerts me to movement, and I've set up a routine that announces ""movement detected"" then shows a live feed from the camera. That works about 70% of the time. I always get the announcement, but it's 30-40% chance of not displaying the video. Telling Alexa to ""show me the camera"" one or twice generally gets the job done, but why not the first time? Frustrating.As for a clock/radio/music streamer. Well the playback side is great. Alexa wakes me up on time, finds local radio stations, or plays music from Amazon music no issues. The sound quality is ok, great for the price, but a couple of 2"" speakers can't work miracles.I've also played a couple of videos from Prime video on it and they looked pretty good. Setup was fairly easy and it's network connection has been stable since I bought it.I've ended up ordering a couple more for other rooms during the Prime Day sales. Overall, I think the Show 8 is in a sweet spot of features and price.  "
"168","Bob","Reviewed in Australia on 25 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Having previously owned a Google Smart Speaker, upgrading to the Echo Show 8 was like stepping up to the next generation of smart devices. The setup was very simple using the visuals on the super clear 8"" screen. Having the screen adds a new dimension to controlling my smart devices and accessing my Spotify playlists, as I no longer need to open the control App on my phone to do things. All my Spotify playlists are displayed on the Echo display as well for easy selection. Connecting the smart devices previously controlled via the old Google Smart Speaker was seamless with simple migration of the accounts across to Alexa, including smart devices linked to my Grid Connect account. We can do so much more with the Echo Show 8, such as being able to view appointments on my calendar and asking for cooking recipes, a time saver as we no longer need to rustle through pages of recipe books. My wife also likes it as she can now see the lyrics to her favourite songs on the display and can finally now sing along with the correct words. Most importantly, I picked up this device for under AU$100 during the Black Friday deals, a real bargain for a great device.  "

Prior to purchase, the indication I had from initial internet research was that Tidal Music was supported.  However, on receiving the Echo and setting it up, I found that Tidal Music is NOT supported.  More detailed internet research on the issue confirmed that.Misled, I think, by how skewed internet results are towards the US market, such that I initially didn't spot the relatively few references to lack of support in Australia.I really don't understand why though?

"178","Johnny Lin","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        I used Google Nest Minis for months to years before deciding to switch to Amazon Echoes. I gave it a few months with the Echoes which seem more customisable than the Google ones which is nice, but the Echoes really started to show their cracks.

I originally used ""Computer"" which had the same problem - the mic is just not as sensitive as the Nest Minis, and it seems to want me to pause after saying ""Alexa"". You can say ""Alexa, turn the lights on"" but not ""Alexa turn the lights on"" (note the comma).Another issue (that I could potentially overlook if the wake word worked) was that I can't use ""Alexa, turn the light on for 5 minutes"" unless I specifically make a routine (ie. a set of actions) that works to do this, and the Nest Minis did this naturally without any preparation. Worse, you have to do for each increment of time that you plan to use in future - if you create a routine for 5 minutes, you need a separate routine for 10 minutes, etc. I put up with this for months and eventually gave up on it about a week ago.The sound from the echo is really good, and the sound from the echo dot is very below average. If I was going to stick with the echoes, I'd buy an echo for each room, maybe even if I didn't plan to play music from it. If I really didn't care, the echo dot's sound would be fine really, but the comparison between the two is a huge difference. It's like comparing telephone/radio quality to CD quality.  "

While the so-called premium sound really doesn't sound much better than my prior Echo, that hasn't turned into as much of a disappointment as the microphone. I sit four or five feet away from it and it only wakes to my voice perhaps 60% of the time. In fact, the echo I have in the next room and down the hall wakes nearly 100% of the time and responds while the new one does nothing. It is incredibly frustrating! With the new echo, it doesn't matter if I'm right next to it, raising my voice over the top of it, shouting at it, or repeating Alexa 20 times in different ways or volume levels! It's hard to express how bad it is!  "

Not sure why Amazon would release this when it's an inferior product. Our Echo Dots work great, I was after something for a bigger room but there's really no need, and I certainly wouldn't recommend this. It's basically a very pretty round ball with blue lights, it's that's what you're after then this is for you!!! If you want a good speaker, buy something else. If you want a good unit to run Alexa, stick with the Dot. Honestly, don't buy this. It is just plain useless and won't pick up your voice.  "

Received it a few hrs ago. Plugged it in. Downloaded the Alexa app', and away we go. I bought it to replace a battery Ryobi speaker in bathroom. This Echo has great immersive sound, rich & full bass. More than loud enough for the bathroom. I immediately went & plugged it into the tv. Two of these Echos would be great tv speakers. I'm all sorted for tv speakers for all 3 tv setups, with Denon, Meredo, & Technics sound bars & speakers. But a twin setup of these Echos would give any of my other setups a run for their money at half the price & twice the functionality. Interested in how much better the Gen 5's are. A very happy customer. Thanks Amazon üëçEdit- it's been a week & I'm even more impressed with this speaker. This Echo 4th gen punches WAAAY above its weight. Alexia AI is very good. Very intuitive. Hasn't missed a beat. I'm very very impressed. I'll be replacing my bedroom $400 soundbar with two more of these Echo 4th or 5th Gen's synced & linked together. The sound is spot on- beautifully balanced. The bass is rich & punchy. Haven't needed past level 7 volume- mostly 4-6. Can't recommend this product enough üëç  "

Speaker quality is good, but not great, would have preferred something with a little move oomph. But can't complain it does the job and is a great new addition to the house. Can set alarms with ease when cooking, appointment reminders, etc. I listen to my Spotify and favorite local radio station with ease, can even increase and decrease volume with word commands, even mute it if you need to make a call.

"192","Richard W.","Reviewed in Australia on 4 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Writing this review as a first time smart-speaker owner, I don't have any real comparison to similar products.Setup was a breeze. Under 5 minutes from opening the box I had it fully working with my voice. No unnecessary packaging or complicated guides, just a 1 page quick-start.Sound quality is good. It isn't something that I was blown away by, but the music I listen to stays clear enough in my medium sized room even at the loudest volume.Construction feels solid. I'm fairly sure the courier threw it over my fence and the product sustained no damage. The blue colour is fairly subtle and goes with most of my furniture, happy with this decision over the more bland white/ black options.The virtual assistant (Alexa/ Echo) works well and for me was very intuitive. The app is able to teach you any voice commands if you are wondering how to set up a very specific thing, but I've found my first guess almost always works. It was also able to respond to French commands as well as English without any additional setup.Used this speaker predominately to play music/ set timers while I'm cooking, or to get a news/ weather update while I'm running around doing my morning routine. Very convenient being able to set these things up when your hands are busy.Overall very happy with my purchase.  "
"193","Lesley","Reviewed in Australia on 23 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","        If you're planing to 'alexa' your home, spend the extra money and get the premium sound version. No, it wont be as good as a multi room Bose system, but it wont put the same massive dent in your bank account either. Really good sound for the average listener that only requires a power point to work. My tip is put two of these in each room to get a truly dynamic sound at an affordable price, along with all the other features such as news and weather they provide. Also integrated really well with Ring doorbells and smart plugs.  "
"194","Korellai","Reviewed in Australia on 16 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I‚Äôve recently been getting into audio books and wanted something I could easily listen to them with when I‚Äôm in bed. After a little research I decided the new Echo was going to best for my needs, especially with the deal Amazon had running at the time - almost half price for the premium sound option!Being a bit of an audiophile / snob, some of the reviews did make me a little anxious that it wouldn‚Äôt live up to expectations - how wrong they were. I‚Äôm not sure if these reviewers got a device from a ‚Äòbad batch‚Äô, but the audio quality is actually amazing, from a device so small and with such an interesting design. I‚Äôm extremely impressed. The microphone has never missed a beat either, I‚Äôve not had to repeat myself once. Maybe software has improved the reliability of this since the other reviewers posted about theirs not always working? Not sure. But mine is perfectly fine.As for Alexa in general, I can‚Äôt get over how good it is. It understands my commands straight away and does what I ask almost instantly. Want to listen to a UK radio station? Just say ‚ÄòAlexa, play BBC radio 1‚Äô. Less than a second later, it‚Äôs on. Want to know how to say something in Chinese? Just ask. She‚Äôll tell you, then go straight back to what was playing.I know I‚Äôm only just scratching the surface with what Alexa can do but coming from someone who‚Äôs resisted voice control for a number of years either due to its reputation of being ‚Äònot good enough yet‚Äô or just feeling gimmicky, I‚Äôm glad I finally pulled the trigger. This Echo is easily my new favourite thing. And for only 80 bucks, it‚Äôs an absolute steal for the sound quality and ease of use.  "
"195","Stuart Burney","Reviewed in Australia on 29 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        For context: I own the echo dot 3rd gen, echo dot 4th gen, Echo plus 2nd gen and now the Echo 4th gen.Let's get right to why this isn't a five star review. The microphones. Amazon actually took a step backwards and went with a 4 microphone array that is inferior to the Echo plus 2nd gen (and echo 3rd gen), which have a seven microphone array. This is the only downfall of this speaker.I'm not a big fan of the spherical design either but that's a subjective opinion. What that translates to in the real world is a voice pickup that is good but not great. This was a major disappointment for me since I use my Echo speakers to control all smart home devices (~30 devices) and mic pickup is crucial for that.As for what this speaker does right:-Better sound quality with a bigger emphasis on mid range. It won't blow you away. It's still V shaped and punchy but it's good. The treble was a little spikey for me but it's a step in the right direction regardless-Faster processor. Everything it does it just a little bit more snappy than the other models-Support for Matter. It's not released yet but this will make a huge difference in the future-The power adaptor is slimmer and no longer blocks the neighbouring power socket. FINALLY.-Zigbee support. My Echo plus 2nd gen has this and little door sensors have changed my smart home gameWhat could use some improvement:-Apparently this speaker has an ultrasound sensor. Apparently it's about as useful as if it didn't. Tried it on this speaker and the 4th gen echo dot for triggering smart home routines and it did absolutely nothing. Who knows, updates might fix this-the sphere can hide that light ring at the bottom sometimes so you don't know if Alexa heard you or is just giving you attitude-the black speaker now comes with a white adaptor? WHYY-this has a new low power mode. And this supposed low power mode doesn't work if you have Spotify linked to your echo speaker. Are you okay Amazon? Spotify is the most used music streaming serviceTLDR: this speaker is a compelling product in the echo line-up and has so much more potential. It has a few shortcomings and a couple of hiccups but it's a solid pick. I'd hesitate to pay full price but it's a strong contender on sale.  "

"210","GayleH","Reviewed in Australia on 19 November 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars","        I had really high hopes for this but it rarely responds to my voice and sound quality is poor to fair. Not sure why Amazon would release this when it's an inferior product. Our Echo Dots work great, I was after something for a bigger room but there's really no need, and I certainly wouldn't recommend this. It's basically a very pretty round ball with blue lights, it's that's what you're after then this is for you!!! If you want a good speaker, buy something else. If you want a good unit to run Alexa, stick with the Dot. Honestly, don't buy this. It is just plain useless and won't pick up your voice.  "

"226","Dash Starkey","Reviewed in Australia on 9 October 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars","        If you already have the Alexa app and buy this on your Amazon account, it automatically connects once you turn it on. So using it is so simple. A great little unit. Sound is strong and positive. She's very quick and responsive as are all the Echo's. Once you get one, you just want more! Bought an Arlec Smart LED Globe and Alexa connects it instantly once it is set up in it's GRID app. Alexa can dim it, change it's colour. So much fun. Can even understand my father who has Parkinson's and can't project his voice clearly. In a semi noisy room it can pick up his commands.  "

"228","Dash Starkey","Reviewed in Australia on 9 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","        Out of all the smart speakers out there, Alexa still holds the number 1 position in this lower class of smart speakers mainly because of that microphone. It still cuts through the noise, doesn't do anything smart when it doesn't need to (Google Nest Mini's loves to try to do more background processing for whatever reason and as a result, kills its performance) and gets even better with this current generation with temperature sensors and ultrasound detection for those times when you need to turn on an audio detection capability. I haven't had a chance to use the ultrasound detection smarts yet to see how good the home intrusion works and am looking forward to seeing if it can handle false positives such as when thunder is in the air or when some construction noise happens outside.All in all, love it. Except the colour. Gone are the lighter hazier colour tones from the 4th generation and in its place, I get a dark harsher blue which is not as appealing and doesn't fit well except in your home office settings.Apart from this, a great smart speaker that will serve your home well.

"229","I have some already and they are absolutely amazing. ","Reviewed in Australia on 30 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        a for amazing. So easy to use. Quality product by Amazon. I have one hooked up to the TV and the other for primarily music in  the family room. Great sound. And Alexa is getting used to my pronunciation. Love it. I purchased a few to spread around the house so I have music everywhere I go. Absolutely recommend this unit.  "
"230","Michael","Reviewed in Australia on 20 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Good -> the usual things I ask, what's the weather, play music, set timers and reminders.Bad - or perhaps my misunderstanding, that it should only recognise voices that was completed during setup.  If the room has the TV on or other noise, then it does take a few attempts for the device to hear you.  "
