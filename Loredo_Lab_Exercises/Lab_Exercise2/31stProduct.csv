"4","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","teguh nistanto putra","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        These are without a doubt some of the most impressive earbuds you'll be able to buy in this price bracket, even better than many that are several times the price.Along with a sleek and stylish cyberpunk aesthetic, these earbuds have clear mid-high tones and a deep bass that's surprisingly good for their size, as the ""music mode"" definitely enhances this. Connects easily to my Galaxy S21 and has no connectivity issues whatsoever.I'd highly recommend these to anybody looking for a brilliant pair of budget earbuds, particularly if wanting to use them primarily for listening to music.

"10","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Yichao Li","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Used for playing music so far. Bass is fairly good, doesn't distort even at full volume. The controls do take a little getting used to since there's not a physical button and there can be a bit of a lag.Haven't worn it for extended periods or during exercise but seems to stay secure in ears and doesn't get particularly uncomfortable compared to what would be expected for the form factor  "
"11","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","glennen2","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 3 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Just amazing. Beautiful design and user friendly features. The only problem found was in the user manual which the company should have put first time use rules up front and explain clearly. The product should also be fully charged by the company before use. The product itself is amazing though.  "

You don't need spend more and buy something else. These are premium quality for such a low price. Highly recommended, quick shipping, genuine product.

Excellent price for such great ear buds. Very happy with them!  "
"34","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Jenny Lee","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 February 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        I’ve had these for almost a year now and I couldn’t be more satisfied. It’s affordable, but the quality of it never lets me down. The sound quality is great and they feel comfortable in my ears. And durable too! I dropped them so many times but they still worked no matter what. Sadly, I lost the case recently and had to use my warranty, but the customer support was amazing! They helped me through every step of the way and got me a new product. I’m really thankful for them. The only complaints I have its that the battery doesn’t last too long, but if you charge them for a few minutes they’re good to go again. And the protection screens inside the earbuds fell off, but I believe that’s my fault for bad management. They worked just fine though, I just needed to be careful not to get water in there.TLDR: Great product for music and gaming, great customer support. Will be buying from them again soon, I definitely recommend. 10/10(P.S.: The pictures are of my new earbuds, the last one is of my year old one that I lost the case of. They still work though, so I use them sometimes!)  "

"36","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ","Victor","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 August 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","        These are fun, decent quality wireless headphones.  I bought these as a replacement for a pair of Skullcandy Indy ANC. Out the box fit is decent and easy to set up.The good ear fit works well for natural noise canceling but it doesn't have any active noise canceling features.The sound quality is soild, a little lacking when you try it againsy some other headphones, but for the price it's a nice little gem.

"45","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ",NA,"Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 20 December 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars","        UPDATE!  Don't let the batteries get because they stop charging.  I can't even send them back now either because my return window has closed.  I still highly recommend these ear buds tho.  I am ordering another pair.  This time I will keep them cooler.  LolI often look on amazon for truly wireless earbuds.  I want the best sound without spending a bunch of money.  I FINALLY found that with these ear buds!  They are so good and sound great.  They fit in my ears perfectly and I finally feel like I have something that can give Bose and Beats and any other brand of ear buds a run for their money.  They sound so good and look pretty cool too.  They come very well packaged too.  The actual packaging and the storage/charging unit that comes with are just as good as the ear buds.  Get them and I promise you won't regret this purchase.  "
"46","Samsung 3.5mm Earphone (EO-IA500), Black  ",NA,"Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 9 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        [Update] talked with customer service about the issue and they sent a replacement, gotta say was not expecting that so I'm satisfied with the new buds they work great and the volume adjustment isn't as finicky as my last pair but we'll see how they hold up. Once again thanks to the great customer service at black shark.Only had it for less than 2 months and it worked great the volume adjustment needs some work but the bass was good too until the volume in the right bud suddenly went down. Idk what happened I didn't drop it (the left bud I dropped but works the same) I didn't submerge it in water... a shame cus now I have to use only one bud cus of the volume imbalance but other than that these are great.
