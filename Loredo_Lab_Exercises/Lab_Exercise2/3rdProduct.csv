"1","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs (Black)  ","Haydn Malyon","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 26 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        Surprising value and great quality overall.Changing the buds can be a little tricky, but not too hard once you get the hang of it. You sort of have to peel it back and pinch it to slip it on. The variety of buds provided is generous. And luckily, once you find the ones that are most comfortable, you probably won't have to change them again.Usually, in-ear headphones are very uncomfortable for me, but when I switched to the bigger buds provided, I find I can easily wear these for hours with no issue.Just a heads up, they do get very loud very easily.Sound quality is great though! Highly recommended!  "
"2","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs (Black)  ","Dmitry Samokhin","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Purchased these IEMs for my phone when my Sennheiser CX 350BT Wireless In-Ear Headphones failed. Was not expecting much and at first thought they were OK but sound was a bit thin. I also tried them using my DAP Shanling C3X and again OK. But after about a week of use, they seemed to come alive with clear, transparent warm sound comparable to another pair of my more expensive IEMs. I play classical music from my stored library and from internet radio-ABC Classical. I am very satisfied with the performance from both sources.I plan now to purchase the Blue Tooth cable for more flexibility using these IEMs.I am sure that a balanced cable for my C3X would also be of benefit.Also they fit well in the ears and OK for extended listening.Great seal.One quibble was that difficult to see the L R marks on cable for fitting the buds.Highly recommended for quality sound at a great price.

"5","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs (Black)  ","Harry P","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 13 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Introduced to KZ via their KZ ZSN Pro Xs under recommendation of Dankpods (youtube), and purchased these ZS10s as a step-up, as the price difference is marginal and considering the ZSN Pro Xs were so good, what could possibly go wrong?The answer: Nothing. They deliver, and they deliver well! Earbuds like ear plugs, meaning you don't need any fancy noise cancelling, as there's just no noise at all. Cable is nice but not braided like the ZSN Pro X model I have, which was a bit disappointing as it has a bit of memory and likes to coil up a bit, but with wear, it straightens out fine.Keep it up KZ!

I was using shure 535s on a gig and was given these to try - I didn’t touch the 535s from that point onward and ordered on the spot. Vocal clarity, ability to determine pitch clearly, 5-7k boost, so good. I had my JH Audio 16s stolen and was going to purchase again, no need to now. Very impressed.  "

"11","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs (Black)  ","OMN1","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        Was looking for a comfortable pair for earphones to listen to music with a higher quality without the need to wear massive headphones. Never knew about IEM's did about ten mins of research and was convinced that these ZS10 PRO is what I needed, I was not disappointed.It takes a bit of fiddling to get the ear plug that works for you, but when you do its heaven. A crisp sound with deep bass (I listen to a lot of edm, rock, metal, screamo and phonk plus the occasional 80's classics) and these produce sounds I've never heard before within songs. 10/10 if you're looking at getting a pair of comfortable earphones what are crazy obvious, you're wearing some which produce great sound, go no further.

"14","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs (Black)  ","Endro Wedianto","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        I followed the instructions and started with the smallest silicon earpieces. Ended up with the second smallest, which are comfortable, and still seal the ear canals.I couldn't see a L or an R anywhere but figured the cable with the button is the right channel.Worked out which way around the pods go and plugged them in.I am listening to them through a XDUOO XD05 Bal DAC/Headphone Amp.Hard to say they sound as good as my $400 Sony WH1000 Noise-cancelling headphones, but they sound great, and I have no desire to change. They are truly a comfortable fit once you get the silicon earpiece sizes sorted. Also a lot less cumbersome to wear and not as expensive to lose as the WH1000 Headphones; and they fit in my pocket, although I'd probably use a pouch first.3.5mm plug didn't want to plug into the phone and stay but did snap into the 3.5mm to 6.5mm adaptor that plugs into the DAC.Well worth the coin.

"15","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs (Black)  ","Daniel Gorgievski","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        They work, They're loud, They're clear (very Clear) and I think that they will go pound for pound with many of the other models out there with a much higher price point. If you are looking to buy these for everyday use and not professional use. Then you have found a decent set of plugs.... Now, you're gonna have other users tell you they are muddy, tinny, lack mid and even have overpowering mids.. let's face it, you're probably not even going to notice as a standard user listening to Spotify... If you're a professional and need them for specific work or whatever, then this isn't the review for you. All i can say as what i call a standard user/music lover they get the job done and done very well... Fit better then that air pods pro from a fit side. Do have some weight from the styling of the metal and the cable will question your ability to set them up.. The over ear cable also secured them well after i had to swap the way i put them together. Passive sound isolation is as others would be. Ear tips a comfortable. Cable length is acceptable. would buy again if i had to purchase another pair.  "

I’m also biased because this is my first ever in-ear monitor, but if you are in the same place as me, it is a great choice. It can be a bit bulky when you put it in your ear, if you get to compare with other brands. But who cares? It is comfortable in my ears. :D  "

And it’s super comfortable and at times you forget you’re wearing it.My only complaint is that the cable is a bit too short for my needs. These are my first ever in ear monitor earphones so not sure if that’s a standard length hence I didn’t take off any stars for it.Otherwise I’m happy with it. Sound quality was great, already helped me fix some of my vocal and guitar mixing for my helix live performance presets.I do recommend the purchase.  "

They are still quite 'punchy' without that cheap sound feel from $5 headphones.Not as good as bose headphones or more expensive sony.Still much better than anything else at this price.The sound clarity I would rate 7/10.Found them quite comfortable.Would buy them again at this price.Decent degree of sound isolation.Gives an immersive feel to the sound that I find quite nice. Feels like the sound is in your head. Doesn't have that large sound stage but these are in ear so eh.They are now my go to headphones if I'm using them at home  "

Lived up to expectations as described in numerous reviews.My evaluation is based on listening to music tracks having a full range of the sound spectrum.Compared with other headphones, sound great.Have to be worn and inserted in the ear correctly to obtain the best of the sound characteristics these units can deliver.Yet to try on intended use, monitoring electronic drums however.Great sound for the price.

The tone is warm and detailed, with the bass being round, defined and not muddy at all with decent low end extension.  I found myself skipping through tracks trying to find a genre that they would stumble on, but they're surprisingly well balanced.  If you're interested in seeing what these multi-driver IEMs are like without spending too much money, I doubt you'll be disappointed with these.  Whether they last any length of time, we'll see.. I really hope they do.  "

Super clean sound and so interesting to hear something so compact produce such a powerful sound. The high end is present but never over the top at all. Such a good tune from these guys even listening to super loud mixes. The clarity is insane moving from over the ear headphones that are more than double the cost.Cannot recommend these enough!

These completely blow my US $1500 custom moulded 6 driver IEMs out of the water, as well as all my other leading brand IEMs. I am completely amazed at the sparkling top end, perfect amount of bass and slightly rolled back mids. For me, the default ear buds perfectly isolate the outside noise. I immediately bought a second pair as well as the upgraded cables. Using these now as my main IEMs on stage.  "
"30","Moondrop Space Travel TWS Earphone Bluetooth 5.3 Noise Canceling True Wireless Stereo IEMs (Black)  ","Christian Ramsden","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        My first KZ product was a pair of AS10's, which I loved and still have 2 years later. I wanted a new set of earphones (with a mic) to use for conference calls (Skype / Zoom etc) at my workstation. For that purpose these work great. I find them comfortable to wear for hours at a time and frequently use them to listen to music and edit video work.I was very surprised to hear the EQ difference between these and the AS10's. Both have more clarity and detail than anything I've used before, including $400+ Bose headphones. The ZS10's have a far brighter EQ than the AS10's (which are warmer and more bottom heavy, but not what I'd call boomy). The ZS10's have a lot of top end clarity and fairly tight/controlled bass. I boost the bass slightly on my SoundBlaster external interface. Switching between these two earphones is chalk and cheese, but after a few minutes on either I'm content.For 5 drivers per side, at this sort of money, this is hard to beat.  "

I bought these ZS10 Pros on a whim to see if they would be any good in comparison to my Bose QC25 or Corsair HS70 Pros.They blow both completely out of the water. It's an entirely different listening experience.Listening to music is an absolute joy with these IEMs. I can hear instruments and other subtle parts of a track I didn't know existed before. The bass is punchy without being overbearing and the highs are crisp and clear. The highs can be a little too loud at times but this hasn't caused any ear strain.Overall, a fantastic package. Highly recommend for first IEMs.  "

I owned a pair of Hyperx Cloud 2 headphones previously and changed out the ear muffs after the wear and tear of the original finally got to it, and it was great. But after changing to these, I can say with certainty that this was worth (although I now had to upgrade my whole setup but eh, it is what it is).If you're looking to get something reasonable and with a better sound profile, boy do I recommend these.

The comfort is something that I find to be ever so slightly an issue. For long sessions I find myself having to take them out for short amounts of time to give my ears a rest. The case presses against my inner ear and makes it slightly sore. Other than that they are amazing!  "
