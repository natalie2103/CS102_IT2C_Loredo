"1","Anker soundcore Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Big Bass, 6 Mics, Clear Calls, Multi Mode Noise Cancelling, Wireless Charging, Soundcore App with Gaming Mode, Sleeping Mode, Find Your Earbuds  ","Nic B.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 20 February 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars","        I read good things about these in audiophile forums and wasn't disappointed.They have surprisingly good clarity, resolution and instrument separation for the price.Their sound is on the bright side of things, but not fatiguing. It's a shade brighter than neutral. There can be the occasional sharp spike in the high-mids, but not bothersome.But it depends on the person's taste. If you like a warm/dark sounding IEM then these are probably not for you.The bass is tight and lean, it's not woofy or artificial. If you're a bass head then it's probably not going to be enough for you, but if you like ""accurate"" bass then you will like these. The rumble is there, but it takes more of a supportive role than a primary role.The soundstage is accurate. Not overly wide, not overly narrow. You get the punch in the middle while getting a good amount of width. The imaging is good, I can easily pick out where each instrument is coming from.The comfort okay, not bad, not great. I can't wear them for more than 1.5 hrs before I start to wanna take them off. But I've got stiff cartilage in my ears which makes them sensitive to pressure over time, so most ppl should be fine.They are more comfy than my previous Bluetooth IEMs though.I don't love the look of the cable but it's not a deal breaker. Seems to sound good.Build quality is great with the all metal shells. I have no fear of them breaking in my pocket.I'm surprised they are this cheap, they're really good. Don't get me wrong, they're not gonna wow you as much as some great headphones, but their Amazon rating should be higher than 4.4. I bought some Bluetooth earphones for around the same price a few years ago and these are twice as good. These are underrated.Easy to drive too. I have them playing through my phone.  "

I did however change the cable and the tips because I had some laying around. Having a good ear seal is essential if you want get the experience everyone is having with these beauties. Stock, they were impressive but now they are awesome, well for the price that's for sure. You won't need any special audio equipment to make these sound good.I did try a few simple mods to see what could be done with these puppies and I was yet again impressed by one mod that I use on my letshuoer s12s. Instead of describing what I did, just search for ""letshuoer s12 micropore tape"" on YouTube. This gave me more bass and a wider sound stage. Well, to my ears it did, but it might be different for yours but the mod is worth a try :)You can't go wrong with these. Enjoy them!  "

It is astonishing you can get something that sounds this amazing for $39Up until now I have avoided IEM because of fitment issues. These are a nice size and quite comfortable. The silicone tips that came with them are not for me. I ordered a variety pack of foam tips and the large ones were just the ticket. I struggled until that point getting a good seal, and was somewhat disappointed with the low end. Once the proper tips for me were put on, now the seal is tight and sounds perfect on the bottom end.If you like a nice clean open sound, with crystal clear mids and highs, with a generally solid bottom end, these are great. The sub frequencies are present and accounted for, just don't slam like some people like.These are exceptionally easy to drive so no extra stuff is needed. a simple usb c dongle is fine.  "

I'm just a casual listener but after trying this one, I can definitely say these are really good. The IEMs itself feel premium with its metal coating. It feels heavy in hand and the sound places the vocals in front of the instruments. The bass is decent, not too bass heavy but it's there. It just sounds great with general music listening (pop) and content watching. Gaming wise I feel like it's better if you get another IEM as the soundstage is not too wide in my opinion, so intricate sounds like footsteps is harder to pinpoint the exact direction. For the price, I thought it's a really good purchase for a daily earphone.  "

Es demasiado habitual encontrar auriculares en los que el anunciante promete una fantástica calidad de sonido, pero pocas veces ofrece la respuesta de frecuencias.La calidad de sonido siempre será una cuestión personal, pero este modelo da lo que promete de forma objetiva. Su respuesta de frecuencias, mostrada en gráfica, es congruente para unos auriculares intraurales, con la típica caída en la parte alta del espectro en este tipo de dispositivo, lo que otorga un sonido fiel a la grabación. Si alguien prefiere realces en graves, medios o agudos, siempre podrá acudir a una ecualización básica, pues la buena respuesta de frecuencia de estos auriculares permite cambios audibles con leves ajustes.Por otro lado el tacto de los auriculares muestra una excelente calidad de fabricación.No veo la necesidad de gastar más dinero para obtener mejor calidad de sonido en unos auriculares intraurales; ni tampoco una mejor estética, para quien sea sensible a las apariencias.

Scherzo ovviamente... c'è anche  altro... (o no ?...). Scherzi a parte parliamo di queste Cuffie, che dire, così come scritto nel titolo, sono (esteticamente) dei gioiellini, e si sentono molto molto bene! Li ho preferiti dopo aver letto le entusiastiche recensioni sui vari siti del settore, head-fi.org in primis, e senza farla troppo lunga, sono parecchio d'accodo con loro.Credo che sia impossibile trovare qualcosa di meglio a questo prezzo, specie con driver singolo. Di mio ho fatto 2 confronti: 1) Truthear Hexa e Questi: Hexa un pò più ""brillanti"", ma con meno bassi, anche se equalizzando un po' si risolve, Questi: Bassi pieni e corposi, medi ottimi, al pari o quasi degli Hexa, medioalti molto molto buoni, alti un po' setosi. Palcoscenico meglio questi, un pò più ampio. 2) Cuffie fai da te,(Vedi foto) *Coppe in ciliegio (100 €),*Driver Free Edge in Biocellulosa da 32 ohm, 110 db (120 €), con Earpads in Pelle Customizzati (20 €)  (Over Ear, Cloni delle mitiche R10 !)

Dadurch, dass es keine krassen peaks oder dips gibt, ist er auch sehr einfach mit EQ zu verändern. In meinen Ohren sitzen die IEMs leider nicht sehr komfortabel, das wird aber wieder von der Person abhängen.  Was mir negativ am Klang aufgefallen ist, ist, dass er nicht sonderlich natürlich klingt und es sich manchmal so anhört, als würden die Instrumente nicht richtig zusammen funktionieren. Er klingt generell sehr trocken und weniger ""abgeschlossen"", was glaube ich mit der Geschwindigkeit des verwendeten Treibers zusammen hängt.  Die Stimme ist meistens nicht sonderlich fokussiert, sondern steht eher im ganzen Raum, wovon ich kein Fan bin.Damit sind wir beim Positiven: Der IEM ist enorm hochauflösend. So, wie ich es noch nie bei einem IEM gehört habe, inklusive vielen, die bis zu dem Zehnfachen kosten. Immer wenn ich mit anderen IEMs Künstler wie Bob Dylan oder Faber höre, habe ich das Gefühl die Textur auf der Stimme komme nicht richtig rüber, wenn man es mit einem HD600 vergleicht. Das ist natürlich nicht fair, und ich sage nicht, dass der ew200 ganz da ist, aber ich habe zumindest nie das Gefühl, dass ich etwas verpasse. Die Klarheit und Seperation der einzelnen Details ist auch wirklich enorm gut. Ich habe gestern eine Vorlesung mit dem HD600 geguckt und dann zu dem ew200 gewechselt und mir ist sofort ein ganz eindeutiger Hall im Raum aufgefallen, den ich vorher nicht gehört hatte. Der Bass ist ohne EQ sehr laut, ich habe ihn 7db runtergestellt, was theoretisch deutlich niedriger ist, als ich normalerweise höre, aber der ""punch"" ist so gut, dass mir das garnicht so vorkommt. Im vergleich zu etwas wie dem 7hz Timeless ist das wirklich Tag und Nacht. Da ist der Bass noch lauter, aber es gibt garkeinen richtigen impact. Sachen wie die Textur auf der Stimme kommen da auch so gut wie garnicht rüber. Generell ist Einzige, was der Timeless besser macht das aufgeräumt sein und die Kohärenz des Klangs. Könnte ich nur einen behalten, würde ich auf jeden Fall diesen nehmen. Wenn ihr von etwas, wie einem Truthear Hola kommt, ist die Auflösung eine komplett andere Welt, ich könnte mir sogar vorstellen, dass sie am Anfang überfordert.    "

With these you get a substantial improvement in build quality for that single step up the price ladder, with a nice metal shell that I find very comfortable to wear for prolonged periods (I find I enjoy putting them in when they're cold!) and decent quality braided cable. A lot has been written about how these sound, I'd just reiterate that they're on the brighter side than I'm used to, but not at all tiring, there is a richness and clarity with technical detail and a tight and precise bass response that I enjoy. This IEM journey has been a cautious one for me, I'm not ready to spend the sort of money I would on some decent open back headphones. But the Simgot EW200s represent excellent value for money in my opinion.  "

Plentiful bass with a high quality tone, excellent male and female vocals, impactful percussion, well tuned and pleasant highs with good energy but not fatiguing or sibilant.

Their soundstage, imaging and separation are in line with 200 pound iem's, at least from my experience of owning various iem's. I often use these for classical, jazz and acoustic based music. Heavier rock, pop, EDM, will probably benefit from more full midrange and bass.  "

The bass in these is actually quite lackluster, but it allows everything else to sound very clear. Metal sounds phenomenal in them. Hip-Hop and EDM is very clear but it lacks the needed bass. The only true con is that these are not comfortable at all. My ears always hurt after I'm done using them. Overall, the best money I've ever spent on headphones.  "

This is 100x better than the Bluetooth jbls I was using before.Bass is wonderful.  They go so low, but are not boomy. highs aren't exhausting.  Mid range is full.  The detail across everything is remarkable.  I'm finding Subtle production/ instrument details I have never heard before.So glad I tried this!  "

These do not fall into that category. These will be in my daily rotation of prefered IEM's.The bass has some punch with texture, not bass head but very enjoyable. The mids are nice and clean, not laid back and thin but not shouty, this is a difficult thing to pull off on budget iem's. The treble has some air to it but at no point does it get fatiguing. I really have to say that on each the bass, mids and treble the word to describe these is clarity. They all come across without stepping on each other, neither of the three are the dominant sound being pushed out but together they are relaxing and smooth with detail.I can not say anything about the tips as I did not even look at them, never use stock tips. The cable is ok, yes really just ok, it does it job. I have seen better and I have seen much worse. I used my cable out of the box but if need, I could use theirs.All in all, these are much better than what I expected and I thing better than 90 pct of the sub 50 IEM's being offered today.  "

Instead of spending the $500 to replace them, I did some research and decided on trying the EA500LM out. I am totally impressed. They are incredibly comfortable for in-ear monitors and have a surprisingly wide dynamic range, with a solid bass & surprising sound imaging. I have bumped my bass eq up +2 instead of running a flat EQ setting and think that these are so good at that level. Highly recommend these for consumer level audio.  "

I have owned Moondrop Katos, Truthear x Crinacle zeros and many more. These are my favorites thus far. I've used them for both gaming and music and everything is clear and concise with the direction audio for games coming through perfectly. For music I can zero in on any specific part and hear it all. I wish they came in more colors but I know that's much more a me problem than a fault in the iems. For the price I doubt you're going to find better.  "

Don't waste your effort reading reviews, comparisons.  These stretch the sonic limits of my ears.The fit is great, the cable ok, but weird texture.
