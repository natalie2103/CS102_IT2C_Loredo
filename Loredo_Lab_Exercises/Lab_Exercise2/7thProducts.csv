Su diseño y su calidad de audio están increíbles. No sé si es en lo que me acostumbro pero al principio por tiempos prolongados si lastiman un poco el oído. La caja debería tener mejor dos bisagras ya que una sola da la sensación de fragilidad y de movimiento. Pero en general para su precio son muy muy buenos    "
"6","Nothing Ear (2) Wireless Bluetooth Earphones Black - ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) Headphones, Hi-Res Audio Certified, Dual Connection, Powerful 11.6 mm Driver  ","Parker Jensen","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","        EAR 1 (white):I had the nothing Ear 1s before, and liked the fit and design of them very much. The case was also fun to fidget with. I had issues with the noise cancelation, where it would always turn off or wasn't calibrated correctly everytime I put them in. The headphones would also lose signal every so often and go silent for a second.Ear 2 (black):I wanted to upgrade as I heard they fixed and upgraded a lot of the features.Noise cancelation: The noise cancelation now has a few more modes and keeps the setting you chose! A neat feature now is when you take one Ear bud out, it automatically switches the other ear bud to transparent mode until you put the other ear bud back in. These aren't quite as good as my Bose QC35 noise cancelation but do work quite well especially at the gym.Sound: After directly comparing these to the ear 1s, the sound on the ear 2 is noticeable better. The ear 2 also has a customizable EQ in the app. Music and audiobooks are clearer. These also don't have the issue of the first ear 1s where it would lose connection to my phone every once in a while.Ear buds: still fit great, comes with 3 bud sizes. They still look dope. The touch buttons have now been replaced with squeeze pressure sensors which remove accidental presses. They also play a satisfying feedback click noise.Case: still sleek, and fun to fidget with. Love the materials they used. Crispier edges. LolCost: The cost is reasonable, these aren't cheap but they won't blow the bank.Cons: here are a few of my only cons.- The noises when switching noise cancelation modes or connecting can be abrasively high-pitched/loud at times. (Wish we could adjust these)- Requires a lot of cleaning depending on how much ear wax you produce lol, especially for the case since you can see through it.  "

"15","Nothing Ear (2) Wireless Bluetooth Earphones Black - ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) Headphones, Hi-Res Audio Certified, Dual Connection, Powerful 11.6 mm Driver  ","Amazonカスタマー","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 March 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars","        TLDR: Amazing for the price but battery life at ~3 hrs is lacking hence 4 stars.Full Story:The most interesting thing about these earbuds is that when you look on line for reviews, every single review compares these to earbuds that are easily twice the price. This is because these earbuds blow away anything in the same price range to the point where it's just competing with the more expensive brands. That should tell you everything you need to know.Sound quality is great! Noise reduction and passthrough is decent, just behind Airpods, but amazing nonetheless especially when considering all other buds in this price range don't have that at all.The app is pretty good, I would say the only downsides is the battery life which is roughly about 3 hours on the buds themselves.Other negative is the beautiful bud case with the clear lexan plastic isn't going to stay beautiful for long. While it doesn't easily scratch, it's going to get scratched up. If you don't care much about that then it isn't a big deal. The layout of the case is really nice, I love how I can just drop the buds in and the magnet pulls them into place.Are you going to get something better in this price range? Probably not unless Apple AirPods go on sale for about half off.  "

Buena en un porcentaje bajo de volumen, ya que suele meter mucho ruido masa si se usa a más del 50 porciento.En general muy buena experiencia con ellos, para su uso diario los encuentro muy bien. Los recomiendo por su diseño, calidad y precio. Pero si el diseño no es algo muy importante para ti, quizá podrías ir por algo de Sony del mismo precio:)    "
